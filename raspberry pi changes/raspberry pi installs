# make sure we have the lastest raspberry OS

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# install hostapd

sudo apt-get install hostapd

#install dnsmasq

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

The installers will have set up the programme so they run when the pi is started. For this setup they only need to be started if the home router is not found. So automatic startup needs to be disabled. This is done with the following commands:

sudo systemctl disable hostapd
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq

And follow instructyion on www.raspberryconnect.com for setting up raspberry pi as hotspot if no wifi is found


ensure the following are installed
# git to allow easier updates to the software
# pip to allow install of other python packages

# flask - potential webserver instead of apache

# mosquitto - 
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
# pyton connectivity to mosquitto
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
